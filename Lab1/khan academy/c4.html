        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/400°F/Gas 6. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, courgettes and a good seasoning of salt. Cook for 20 minutes, until the onion and courgettes are soft.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Heat another tablespoon of the olive oil in a separate saucepan, then add the garlic. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds, then add the passata and cook the mixture gently for 20 minutes, until reduced by half. Season with salt and pepper, then stir through the basil.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Brush both sides of the aubergine slices with olive oil and season them with salt. Place the aubergines in an even layer on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Bake them for 15 minutes, then turn them over and bake them for a further 15 minutes. Remove the slices from the oven and, when they are cool enough to handle, cut them into halfmoons. Set them aside and leave the oven on.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>To make the béchamel, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a low heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour and cook it out for a couple of minutes, stirring to combine. Next, add the hot milk and stir continuously to avoid any lumps forming. Cook the sauce gently for 20 minutes, stirring all the while, until smooth and thickened, then mix in the Parmesan and check the seasoning. Leave to one side.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Mix the aubergines, courgettes, onions and tomato sauce together in a large bowl and check that everything is seasoned well.</p>
    
     <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Use the remaining olive oil to oil a baking dish, then place a layer of lasagne sheets in the base of the dish. Add one-third of the vegetable mixture in an even layer, then top this with one-quarter of the béchamel sauce. Repeat this twice more, then finish with a layer of lasagne sheets and a final layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle the top with some more Parmesan, then bake the lasagne for 35 minutes, until the pasta is cooked and the top is golden. Serve with a little extra grated Parmesan on top, if you like.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Trim 1 bunch of spring onions and place in a blender with 300g of frozen peas and 300g of frozen spinach.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Tear in 100g of smoked ham, pick in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh mint (15g), then cover with 400ml of boiling kettle water.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Put the lid on securely, cover with a tea towel and, holding it in place, blitz until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides and help it along, if needed. Pour into a large pan on a high heat and add another 1.2 litres of boiling kettle water.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Smash up 300g of wholewheat fusilli into random shapes – the easiest way is to wrap it in a tea towel and attack it with a rolling pin – and stir into the soup.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Bring back to the boil, then simmer until the pasta is cooked through, stirring regularly and adding splashes of water to loosen, if needed. Taste the soup, and season to perfection.</p>
    
     <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Divide the soup between bowls or mugs, then use a speed-peeler to shave over 50g of feta in fine strips, before tucking in.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First make the pangrattato. Put 6 tablespoons of oil into a hot thick-bottomed pan.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Peel, slice and add the garlic, strip in the thyme leaves and breadcrumbs; they will fry and begin to toast. Stir for a couple of minutes, or until the breadcrumbs are really crisp and golden. Season with a little sea salt and black pepper and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water until al dente. While it is cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic, then heat gently in a pan with 4 tablespoons of oil.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>As the garlic begins to soften, lay the anchovy fillets over the top. After a minute you will see them begin to melt.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Squeeze in the lemon juice and crumble in the dried chillies.</p>
    
     <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Drain the spaghetti and throw it into the sauce. Taste a bit of pasta – it may need a little more lemon juice and a little extra seasoning. Serve straight away, sprinkled really generously with the pangrattato.</p>
